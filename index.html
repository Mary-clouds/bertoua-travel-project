Bertoua is all that, and a lot more.</p>
    <p>Bertoua (actually: Gamane) is an old central town of the Gbaya and was the seat of a chiefdom in pre-colonial times, which was influenced early on by the neighboring Islamic empires to the north. The town came under German sovereignty after 1903. During this time, however, the district administration was based in Dume, further to the southwest. It was only after the First World War, under French mandate rule, that Bertoua became the administrative center for East Cameroon. </p>

This is back to the basic way of life. You will have the opportunity you join one of the still primitive human family at the dinner table and to learn from their way of life. </p>
