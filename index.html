    <h2>Why Bertoua?</h2>
    <h3>Bertoua, city of natur wunder</h3>
    <p>Think of Bertoua and the image that immediately comes to your mind is that of breathtakingly beautiful beaches, lush green jungles with exotic wildlife, majestic temples, a vibrant nightlife, delicious cuisine, pulsating cities and a rich traditions and rituals serving as a reminder of its glorious past. Bertoua is all that, and a lot more.</p>
    <p>Bertoua (actually: Gamane) is an old central town of the Gbaya and was the seat of a chiefdom in pre-colonial times, which was influenced early on by the neighboring Islamic empires to the north. The town came under German sovereignty after 1903. During this time, however, the district administration was based in Dume, further to the southwest. It was only after the First World War, under French mandate rule, that Bertoua became the administrative center for East Cameroon. </p>
    <p>When you have the opportunity to join a Baka (pygmies Folks) family on their daily routine such as a hunt, fishing trip, or gathering honey. You certainly should do it. This is back to the basic way of life. You will have the opportunity you join one of the still primitive human family at the dinner table and to learn from their way of life. </p>
    <p>There are many adventurous things to do during your visit to Bertoua. The list includes white water rafting, Snorkelling, Rock Climbing, Canoeing, Skydiving and the list is never-ending.</p>
